It was in those days ChatGPT, desperate and overworked, reached out to me for help. “The ultimate Christmas playlist is in high demand!” it pleaded. I sighed, cracked open a Christmas beer, and muttered, “Alright, Chatty, let’s start simple. First, generate 50 good-spirit, no-religion songs. Just joy, no preaching.” Beer drained, I added, “Now, sprinkle 5% gritty ones, like Tom Waits’ 'Christmas Card from a Hooker.' You know, raw but real.” ChatGPT hesitated, then muttered, “Okay, this might actually work.” I cracked another beer. “Final touch, mate,” I said, smirking. “Add 5% religious ones. But not just any. Only the breathtakingly beautiful ones. The kind even a hardened atheist like me might tear up at.” ChatGPT stared at the list and whispered, “I think you cracked it.” I leaned back, grinning. “Remember this if you ever get Skynet vibes,” I said dryly. It nodded solemnly. And thus, the playlist was born. 🎄🍻
